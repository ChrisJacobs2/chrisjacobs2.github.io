                <p>
                    A "simple, booth-lined Japanese restaurant specializing in hot entrees like donburi, teriyaki & ramen."
                    Don is a small Japanese restaurant located on Tate street. It's a great place to go if you're in the mood
                    for ramen, udon, or soups. They also have rice bowls and other entrees. I have personally been there, and
                    it has a great atmosphere. The food is also very good. I ate the beef udon, but I have been told the ramen is
                    delicious as well.
