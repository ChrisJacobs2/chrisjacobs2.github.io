            <h1>Yummy Meals near YOU ...provided you are near the UNCG Petty building.</h1>
            <p>
                Tired of eating cafeteria slop? Want to try something new?
                Maybe something a little more local? Well, you're in luck! (unless your picky)
                This here blog post is dedicated to showing YOU some of the
                best places to eat near the UNCG Petty building. That said,
                don't sleep on the Cafe, they have great food given the price.
                These food still better. I included some cool awesome epic buttons than you can use to
                cycle through the different restaurants. I also included some pictures of the food, and when
                you click on them they will get bigger so your peepers can peep them better. Also, if you
                would like to create your own hypothetical meal plan, you can do so
                <a href="meal-plan.html">
                    here.

                <h2>Don</h2>
                <p>
                    A "simple, booth-lined Japanese restaurant specializing in hot entrees like donburi, teriyaki & ramen."
                    Don is a small Japanese restaurant located on Tate Street. It's a great place to go if you're in the mood
                    for ramen, udon, or soups. They also have rice bowls and other entrees. I have personally been there, and
                    it has a great atmosphere. The food is also very good. I ate the beef udon, but I have been told the ramen is
                    delicious as well. The Chef is a very nice person, and the food is reasonably priced.

                <h2>Jimmy John's</h2>
                <p>
                    "Counter-serve chain specializing in sub & club sandwiches, plus signature potato chips." I have also personally
                    eaten here, as well as ordered delivery. The sandwiches are both much better than subway, and are relatively
                    the same price. They also have a rewards system, so if you love sandwiches, this is a great place to go. Also
                    located on Tate Street. Beware: Jimmy John's is a chain restaurant, so if you're looking for something "local",
                    there are better options. That said, for a corporation, their mottos and sense of humor are pretty funny. And the
                    people who work at this specific establishment are very nice.

                <h2>Yum Yum Better Ice Cream</h2>
                <p>
                    Old school ice cream parlor with a vintage vibe, offering a variety of flavors & toppings. They also have hot dogs
                    and other hot food as well. I get ice cream here sometimes in the summer. Some people don't like it, but I think
                    it tastes great. It's not exactly economical at $3 a scoop, but it's a better deal than most places and the ice cream
                    is better. My favorite is pineapple, and they have about 20ish flavors. You can pick from a cup or a cone, and they give
                    you a fair amount. Make sure to get napkins. They also accept credit card payment, despite the google maps description.
                    Also, their specialty is definitely ice cream. The hot dogs are okay, and they look rather icky.
